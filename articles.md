The Greek article is a little declinable word which has three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter.
There is a definite and an indefinite article which both agree in gender, number and case with the noun they refer to. The accusative singular masculine and feminine of the definite article and the accusative masculine of the indefinite article are used with the letter (ν) when the following word starts with a vowel or the (combination) consonants __κ, π, τ, ξ, ψ, γκ, μπ, ντ__.
